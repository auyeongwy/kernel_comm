Demonstrates kernel-land and user-land communications via character device. This creates a kernel module which upon loading, creates a character device /dev/khello for comunications with userland.
This version of the software uses an older method of creating device drivers.

The software is developed and tested on CentOS 7 with kernel 3.10

To observe the interactions, run:
insmod khello.ko
tail -f /var/log/messages

Then try read and write operations on the created character device /dev/khello

To unload the module, run 
rmmod khello.ko
